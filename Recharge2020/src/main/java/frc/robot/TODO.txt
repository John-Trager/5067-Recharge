Vision Processing:
 - implement LimeLight
    -rotate to target [tune]
    -get distance to target
    -go to target distance and implement with rotate to target
 - implement pixy2cam
    - Tracks Ball nearest it 
    - uses P or PD or PID loop to rotate to ball
    and then collects it (auto)

Gyro IMU:
 - NavX
    - test getAngle() works
        - create PID for turn to angle command or subsystem

Path Weiver:
 - more research and mock a project together
 -see alternate solutions such as time moving with encoder feeback and turn to angle
 - 6 auton paths (2 for each position: left, middle, right)
 -Auton Path:
    - go to target shooting spot
    - aim and fire
    - move to where know balls are 
    - using vision and other sensors collecet balls
    - go back
    - position, aim, fire
    - next know balls or getting reading to go back to ball loader station
    - *alt to ball station go to wheel of fortune and spin it 3 time if goal met (FMS)

Shooter:
 - update and add neo comaptibiltiy
 - creat PIDF loop for ball shooter and test various RPMs
    - get Encoder
    - get PIDF loop tuned

Ball Collecter:
 - mock subsystem together
    -pnuematic solenoid control
    -add move redline motor
 - use motor amperage to predict/ estimate when ball is in system and the when collected

Indexing System:
 - sharp/proximatey sensor
 -775pro motor implemetation with 1:12 gearbox? program with talon/encoder?

 Climb:
 - create routine
    1. elevator goes up, reaches height (know by motor amperage, encoder, or limit switch)
    2. hook detaches 
    3. elevator goes down while 4.
    4. winch begins to pull up
    5. once at desire place lock mech (determine by either encoder, limit switch, or passive locking)
